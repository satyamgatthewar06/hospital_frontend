## 🔄 READY FOR NEXT PHASE

### Backend Integration
To connect to real backend APIs:
1. Create API service layer in `src/services/`
2. Replace context mutations with API calls
3. Add loading and error states
4. Implement token-based authentication
5. Add request/response interceptors

### Example Integration Point
```javascript
// Before (current): Context-based
const addPatient = (patient) => {
  setHospitalData(prev => ({...}))
}

// After (with API): API-based
const addPatient = async (patient) => {
  const response = await api.post('/patients', patient)
  setHospitalData(prev => ({...}))
}
```

### Backend Endpoints Ready
Your backend already has these endpoints:
- `/api/patients` - Patient management
- `/api/doctors` - Doctor management
- `/api/appointments` - Appointment management
- `/api/billing` - Billing and invoices
- `/api/laboratory` - Lab tests
- `/api/wards` - Ward management
- `/api/staff` - Staff management
- `/api/tpa` - TPA management
